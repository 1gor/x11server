##About
A Docker Image running an X-Server (xvfb based) and providing the display via VNC to the host or any other machine.

##Usage

##Maintenance
The image is build on Docker hub with [Automated builds](http://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/). Also a [repository link](http://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/#repository-links) to its parent image is configured. So it is automatically updated, when the parent image is updated.

##Copyright free
The sources in [this](https://github.com/suchja/x11-vnc-server.git) Github repository, from which the docker image is build, are copyright free (see LICENSE.md). Thus you are allowed to use these sources (e.g. Dockerfile and README.md) in which ever way you like.
